  "I think as students of computer science and software engineers, we must have dealt with databases at some point in our lives so far. We were taught SQL during our undergrad and we inserted, read, updated and deleted data from a SQL database. I knew the SELECT statements, triggers, procedures, indexes, etc. but it was only limited to the application part of the science. I just knew what they are and how to use them.",
  "Database by nature, seems so simple. It is a store room for data. We put things, we want to retrieve things, we can update things and we can discard some of them if we want to. But just like a lot of simple things in the world, achieving simplicity takes a lot of mindful thinking to get to where they are. A myriad of things are abstracted away from the end user, so that it becomes simple to use. So being curious in nature, I wanted to know and understand (and if possible build by myself) what happens under the hood of a database. This led me to take up the course CSE 562: Database Systems, during my master's at UB."
